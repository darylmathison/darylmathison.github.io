##### March 2003 – December 2003
The research project was on cross-platform agents.  I refactored a Java Swing 
front end from another project to work as a GUI to control the agents.  The project had a front end developed in Java and the agents were written in Python.  While I was expanding the agent’s functionality, I became responsible for resetting the test range.  To make the test range reset faster I changed a Knoppix distribution to include scripts that automated the reset of a machine.

##### November 2002 – March 2003
Project evaluated Intrusion Detection Systems’ (IDS) performance against attacks found on the internet.  Downloaded attacks had to be debugged to remove bugs added to source code. The downloaded source code was in C. The resulting test results  were distributed to the customer to update signatures.

##### August 2002 – October 2002
Project was a rewrite of CIDDS and added an incident reporting database.  This would allow network analysts to see a network attack and report it in the same interface.  Except for the database, the entire project would was in Java using Java Swing for a front end.  The team used iterative, test-based development methodologies.   I was responsible for implementing unit testing with JUnit.  Every week I lead in a weekly team code audits with the customer attending

##### May 1998 – August 2002
CIDDS was a multi-tier IDS to detect network attacks on the Air Forces networks. Oracle was used as a middleware for storing attack data and serving the data to the application server.  Application server and clients were written in Java Swing and used RMI to communicate.  Wrote and maintained the original application server and client.  Designed and implemented a multi-threaded data loader developed in Java and PL/SQL that could load up to 8 million rows every ten minutes.  The client was rewritten and I assisted in debugging.  Designed and implemented a software layer to make JDBC easier to use.

##### April 1998 – May 1998
Responsible for quality assurance for ASIM releases.  ASIM is an IDS sensor that sends information to CIDDS.  I performed QA duties working closely with the developers to reduce software defects.  I expanded the installation script to include an optional set of libraries and documentation into the machine.
