### Diligent Consulting Inc.
_Technical Consultant_: **March 2007 – Dec 2009**

#### Projects
##### April 2008 – Dec 2009
* Created a custom tab widget using OAF.  Without the custom widget, many requirements would not have been met.
* Developed Dynamic web pages using OAF and JDeveloper.

##### August 2007 – January 2008
Java developer on National Board of Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS) 
reengineering project.  The team used a modified Agile methodology for development.  
Pivotal in creating Subversion repository.  
Responsible for gathering requirements from stakeholders.  
Created test plans from gathered requirements and got stakeholder approval for test plans.  
Implemented requirements using JDeveloper 10 and Oracle ADF technology. 
This included modifying the database views and “instead-of” triggers.  
Some of the views were made from stored XML data.  Once requirements were implemented, 
the stakeholder and I preformed the test plan and recorded the results.  Stakeholder 
had the final say on whether the requirements were met.

##### March 2007 – July 2007
Java developer on Reserve Component Periodic Health Assessment (RCPHA) application 
which enables the Air Force to track troop readiness for World Wide Deployment by 
providing workflow and oversight for several important health related factors: 
Periodic Heath Assessment, Occupational Heath, Pre/Post Deployment, Line of Duty Dispositions, 
Flight Crew Grounding Management and Dental. Built a web site application using 
Java for the U.S. Air Force Reserve Command using Java Servlets and Oracle 10g 
on the Tomcat web container and Oracle’s Internet Application Server (iAS).  
Tuned new and existing SQL and PL/SQL, which dramatically improved database system performance.  
Helped to develop system specifications and schema diagrams to add new functionality 
to an existing Oracle production system.  Worked with managers, legacy system administrators, 
and end users to fully flesh out system requirements and business rules.  Analyzed requirements 
and designed process flow diagrams, data flow diagrams, system ERDs and Schema Diagrams

### General Dynamics AIS (Advanced Information Systems)
_Software Engineer_: **April 1998 – February 2007**

#### Projects
##### January 2004 - November 2006
* Developed on a team to simulate an air traffic control system based on a distributed Fedora 4 network.
* Utilized Bugzilla and CVS to facilitate processes.
* Managed the CVS respository.
* Project was a mixture of kernel and user space using C/C++.
* Implemented a XML schema to save the state of the application in case of a crash.
* Responsibilities expanded to nightly builds and regression testing.  These were automated with a mixture of makefiles and scripts.
* Wrote a paper on how to detect a honeypot.

##### March 2003 – December 2003
The research project was on cross-platform agents.  I refactored a Java Swing 
front end from another project to work as a GUI to control the agents.  The project had a front end developed in Java and the agents were written in Python.  While I was expanding the agent’s functionality, I became responsible for resetting the test range.  To make the test range reset faster I changed a Knoppix distribution to include scripts that automated the reset of a machine.

##### November 2002 – March 2003
Project evaluated Intrusion Detection Systems’ (IDS) performance against attacks found on the internet.  Downloaded attacks had to be debugged to remove bugs added to source code. The downloaded source code was in C. The resulting test results  were distributed to the customer to update signatures.

##### August 2002 – October 2002
Project was a rewrite of CIDDS and added an incident reporting database.  This would allow network analysts to see a network attack and report it in the same interface.  Except for the database, the entire project would was in Java using Java Swing for a front end.  The team used iterative, test-based development methodologies.   I was responsible for implementing unit testing with JUnit.  Every week I lead in a weekly team code audits with the customer attending

##### May 1998 – August 2002
CIDDS was a multi-tier IDS to detect network attacks on the Air Forces networks. Oracle was used as a middleware for storing attack data and serving the data to the application server.  Application server and clients were written in Java Swing and used RMI to communicate.  Wrote and maintained the original application server and client.  Designed and implemented a multi-threaded data loader developed in Java and PL/SQL that could load up to 8 million rows every ten minutes.  The client was rewritten and I assisted in debugging.  Designed and implemented a software layer to make JDBC easier to use.

##### April 1998 – May 1998
Responsible for quality assurance for ASIM releases.  ASIM is an IDS sensor that sends information to CIDDS.  I performed QA duties working closely with the developers to reduce software defects.  I expanded the installation script to include an optional set of libraries and documentation into the machine.
